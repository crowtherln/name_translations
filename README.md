# english_monarchs

This program produces a .csv file with the names of English monarchs in
    different languages. It is part of a project to find which names
    correspond to which other names in different languages. The reason
    for which monarchs are included in this project is that the names of
    ancient, medieval, and early modern monarchs are more likely to be
    translated than are names of contemporary humans.

The program returns some entries that are not for monarchs—or even
    people—but most of the entries are for people.

The program takes about 35 seconds to run.
